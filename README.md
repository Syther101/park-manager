**NOT YET READY FOR PRODUCTION! Things may brake from time to time.**

ParkManager is an open source Hosting-software solution for PHP,
based on the [**Symfony2**](http://symfony.com) framework.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a Hosting-software solution,
which is user-friendly, loved by developers and has a helpful community.
And most of all is safe to use, no hidden back-doors, and secure by design.

Requirements
------------

ParkManager requires at least PHP 5.6, PostgreSQL 9.3 and one or more
hosting servers for managing.

*For specific hosting features you may need to install additional
software. The installation procedure of additional software will vary
and may not be supported for all operating systems.*

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into the release cycle, and for striving
to maintain backward compatibility, RollerworksSearch is maintained under
the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
